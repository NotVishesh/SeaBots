            Causes of Marine Pollution
        </h1>
        <div class="p1_1">
            <h1>Runoff:</h1>
            <img src="assets/Screenshot 2024-02-11 133041.png" alt="" />
            <p>
                Runoff occurs when rain or snow carries pollutants from the ground
                to the ocean. For example, after a heavy rainstorm, oil left by
                vehicles washed from the streets unintentionally ‘runoff’ into our
                storm drains and into the ocean. With runoff coming from various
                locations and sources, it’s a significant cause of pollution. As a
                community, we need to reduce the usage of toxic pollutants to lessen
                the environmental impact of runoff. For example, rather than
                spraying weeds with harsh chemicals, using a natural mix of
                household products, like vinegar, could help.
            </p>

            <h1>Oil spills:</h1>
            <img src="assets/Screenshot 2024-02-11 133257.png" alt="" />
            Crude oil spills are happening too often. A significant contributor of
            releasing harmful oil into our oceans are the ships that transport
            goods from country to country. When crude oil infects the sea, it’s
            challenging to clean up. It can remain in the ocean for years,
            affecting wildlife and the ecosystem as a whole.
        </div>

        <div class="p3_1">
            <h1>Waste:</h1>
            <img src="assets/Screenshot 2024-02-11 133342.png" alt="" />
            The effect of litter and unkept trash is a serious growing problem.
            Litter is considered atmospheric pollution when waste and debris are
            carried by wind to the ocean. Objects such as plastic bags can end up
            in the water, and unfortunately, they don’t decompose. You can help
            reduce this type of pollution by gathering trash you see lying around
            and disposing of it properly.
        </div>

        <div class="p4_1">
            <h1>Fossil fuels:</h1>
            <img src="assets/Screenshot 2024-02-11 133711.png" alt="" />
            Fossil fuels are burned to create energy, but burning fossil fuels
            causes the release of carbon dioxide, which is one of the most
            destructive contributors to climate change. Another downside to
            burning fossil fuels is the residual ash released into the atmosphere.
            When the ash particles are released, they mix with vapor in clouds,
            causing rainwater to be more acidic.

            Adverse Effect of Marine Pollution
        </h1>
        <div class="p1_2">
            <h2>1. Harmful to marine life</h2>
            <img src="assets/Screenshot 2024-02-11 140514.png" alt="" />
            <p>
                Sea animals are frequent victims of ocean pollution. Oil spills, for
                instance, will ensnare and suffocate marine animals by permeating
                their gills. When the oil gets into seabird feathers,<br />
                they may not be able to fly or feed their young. Animals that aren’t
                killed by crude oil may suffer from cancer and behavioral changes
                and become unable to reproduce.
                <br />
                <br />

                Marine animals also mistake small plastic debris for food or become
                entangled in or strangled by plastic bags and discarded fishing
                nets. Animals most vulnerable to harm from plastic debris in the
                ocean include dolphins, fish, sharks, turtles, seabirds and crabs.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="p2_2">
            <h2>2. Depletion of oxygen in seawater</h2>
            <img src="assets/Screenshot 2024-02-11 140800.png" alt="" />
            As excess debris in the ocean slowly degrades over many years, it uses
            oxygen to do so, resulting in less oxygen in the ocean. Low levels of
            oxygen in the ocean lead to the death of ocean animals such as
            penguins, dolphins, whales and sharks.
            <br />

            Excess nitrogen and phosphorus in seawater also cause oxygen
            depletion. When a great deal of oxygen depletion occurs in an area of
            the ocean, it can become a dead zone where very little marine life can
            survive.
        </div>

        <div class="p3_2">
            <h2>3. A threat to human health</h2>
            <img src="assets/Screenshot 2024-02-11 141855.png" alt="" />
            Pollutants in the ocean make their way back to humans. Small organisms
            ingest toxins and are eaten by larger predators, many of which are
            seafood that we eventually eat. When the toxins in contaminated
            animals get deposited in human tissue, it can lead to long-term health
            conditions, cancer and birth defects.
            <br />

            For example, phytoplankton will absorb methylmercury
            (bacteria-converted mercury carried down to the ocean’s surface). This
            makes its way up the food chain when zooplankton eat the
            phytoplankton, then small fish eat the zooplankton, then bigger fish
            eat the smaller fish. By the time you reach a fish the size of a
            swordfish, they can contain a very high mercury load (in fact,
            swordfish contain one of the highest mercury loads).

            Precautions for Marine Pollution
        </h1>
        <div class="p1_2">
            <h2>1. Reduce plastic production & waste</h2>

                alt="" />
            <p>
                Reducing plastic production and waste is one of the most important
                ways we can stop sea pollution. On an individual level, you can
                start by avoiding products containing microbeads and shopping
                plastic-consciously, opting for reusable products over single-use
                wherever possible, and recycling properly.
                <br />
                However, individual efforts alone are not enough to solve the
                problem. We also need legislation that discourages plastic waste,
                reduces plastic production, and improves waste management. The UK’s
                recent announcement of a ban on a range of single-use plastic
                products, for example, is a step in the right direction. More
                pressure on local authorities and governments is needed to take
                these vital steps — and fast.

            We only need to look at very recent history to know that sewage
            pollution is a huge problem. It’s become a worrying reality on our
            doorstep here in the UK, with 372,533 sewage releases being recorded
            in 2021. The systems currently in place simply cannot handle the waste
            of a booming population — London’s sewage system, for one, was built
            by the Victorians. Storm overflows are blamed when, in reality, there
            were no storms putting pressure on the systems in the summer of 2022.
            Untreated wastewater contains a number of pollutants, including
            plastics, chemicals, and pollutants, which pose a risk to human and
            environmental health alike. Improving wastewater infrastructure is the
            only way forward, and when water companies document record profits, it
            is possible.

            <img src="https://newsexaminer.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/significance-of-using-eco-friendly-products.jpg"
                alt="" />
            Using eco-friendly products can significantly reduce the amount of
            pollution entering our oceans. Here are some ways to use eco-friendly
            products to help reduce ocean pollution: Use reusable bags, water
            bottles, and containers: Opt for reusable options over single-use
            items – think cloth bags and stainless steel water bottles &
            containers. Choose natural cleaning products: Many traditional
            cleaning products contain harmful chemicals that harm our oceans.
            Luckily, there are plenty of eco-friendly options out there nowadays,
            made from natural and biodegradable ingredients. Buy sustainable
            seafood: Unsustainable fishing practices harm marine ecosystems and
            contribute to ocean pollution. Instead, opt for sustainably caught
            options that support responsible fishing practices. Use non-toxic
            health & beauty products: Many self-care products contain harmful
            chemicals that can be toxic to marine life. Choose natural and
            non-toxic products — the ocean & your body will thank you!

            Oil spills – like the recent occurrence at Poole harbour – can cause
            severe damage to marine ecosystems and are a significant contributor
            to ocean pollution.
            <br />
            <br />
            It’s imperative that governments and industries alike take measures to
            prevent oil spills and respond quickly to contain and clean up any
            spills that do occur. Whether it’s investing in spill response
            technology, improving the safety standards for offshore drilling, or
            enforcing strict preventative regulations, much can be done to avoid
            oil spills.

            Beach and river cleanups are some of the most direct and rewarding
            ways to fight sea pollution. Whether you attend them or organise them
            yourself, these cleanups not only remove plastic waste from the ocean
            but help raise awareness about the issue — in turn, inspiring others
            to take action.
            <br />

            You can also support organisations undertaking large-scale projects,
            like The Ocean Cleanup and Surfers Against Sewage.

            How do we know what needs changing if we don’t have an accurate
            picture of where we stand? With UK water quality currently in a dismal
            state, it’s clear that ongoing monitoring will keep us on track.
            <br />
            <br />
            Unfortunately, funding cuts to the Environment Agency have stripped
            away much of their capacity for monitoring and the surveillance of
            water companies. Liz Truss, who was in charge at DEFRA between 2014
            and 2016 oversaw a £24m cut from a government grant for environmental
            protection.
            <br />
            Without adequate monitoring, we can’t possibly expect to reach the
            clean water targets set out by the Water Framework Directive. Water
            quality monitoring – on a local, regional, and national level – needs
            to be carried out by authorities, environmental agencies, and
            polluting industries in order to see real change.
