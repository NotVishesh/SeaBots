            <h2>1. Reduce plastic production & waste</h2>

            <p>
                Reducing plastic production and waste is one of the most important
                ways we can stop sea pollution. On an individual level, you can
                start by avoiding products containing microbeads and shopping
                plastic-consciously, opting for reusable products over single-use
                wherever possible, and recycling properly.
                <br />
                However, individual efforts alone are not enough to solve the
                problem. We also need legislation that discourages plastic waste,
                reduces plastic production, and improves waste management. The UK’s
                recent announcement of a ban on a range of single-use plastic
                products, for example, is a step in the right direction. More
                pressure on local authorities and governments is needed to take
                these vital steps — and fast.

            We only need to look at very recent history to know that sewage
            pollution is a huge problem. It’s become a worrying reality on our
            doorstep here in the UK, with 372,533 sewage releases being recorded
            in 2021. The systems currently in place simply cannot handle the waste
            of a booming population — London’s sewage system, for one, was built
            by the Victorians. Storm overflows are blamed when, in reality, there
            were no storms putting pressure on the systems in the summer of 2022.
            Untreated wastewater contains a number of pollutants, including
            plastics, chemicals, and pollutants, which pose a risk to human and
            environmental health alike. Improving wastewater infrastructure is the
            only way forward, and when water companies document record profits, it
            is possible.

            <h2>3. Use eco-friendly products</h2>
            <img src="https://newsexaminer.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/significance-of-using-eco-friendly-products.jpg"
                alt="" />
            Using eco-friendly products can significantly reduce the amount of
            pollution entering our oceans. Here are some ways to use eco-friendly
            products to help reduce ocean pollution: Use reusable bags, water
            bottles, and containers: Opt for reusable options over single-use
            items – think cloth bags and stainless steel water bottles &
            containers. Choose natural cleaning products: Many traditional
            cleaning products contain harmful chemicals that harm our oceans.
            Luckily, there are plenty of eco-friendly options out there nowadays,
            made from natural and biodegradable ingredients. Buy sustainable
            seafood: Unsustainable fishing practices harm marine ecosystems and
            contribute to ocean pollution. Instead, opt for sustainably caught
            options that support responsible fishing practices. Use non-toxic
            health & beauty products: Many self-care products contain harmful
            chemicals that can be toxic to marine life. Choose natural and
            non-toxic products — the ocean & your body will thank you!

            <h2>5. Manage oil spills</h2>
            <img src="https://image.vietnamnews.vn/uploadvnnews/Article/2020/1/22/64686_oilspill.jpg" alt="" />
            Oil spills – like the recent occurrence at Poole harbour – can cause
            severe damage to marine ecosystems and are a significant contributor
            to ocean pollution.
            <br />
            <br />
            It’s imperative that governments and industries alike take measures to
            prevent oil spills and respond quickly to contain and clean up any
            spills that do occur. Whether it’s investing in spill response
            technology, improving the safety standards for offshore drilling, or
            enforcing strict preventative regulations, much can be done to avoid
            oil spills.

            <h2>6. Beach & river cleanups</h2>

                alt="" />
            Beach and river cleanups are some of the most direct and rewarding
            ways to fight sea pollution. Whether you attend them or organise them
            yourself, these cleanups not only remove plastic waste from the ocean
            but help raise awareness about the issue — in turn, inspiring others
            to take action.
            <br />

            You can also support organisations undertaking large-scale projects,
            like The Ocean Cleanup and Surfers Against Sewage.

            <h2>7. Monitoring & measuring progress</h2>
            <img src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.est.2c06018/asset/images/acs.est.2c06018.social.jpeg_v03"

            How do we know what needs changing if we don’t have an accurate
            picture of where we stand? With UK water quality currently in a dismal
            state, it’s clear that ongoing monitoring will keep us on track.
            <br />
            <br />
            Unfortunately, funding cuts to the Environment Agency have stripped
            away much of their capacity for monitoring and the surveillance of
            water companies. Liz Truss, who was in charge at DEFRA between 2014
            and 2016 oversaw a £24m cut from a government grant for environmental
            protection.
            <br />
            Without adequate monitoring, we can’t possibly expect to reach the
            clean water targets set out by the Water Framework Directive. Water
            quality monitoring – on a local, regional, and national level – needs
            to be carried out by authorities, environmental agencies, and
            polluting industries in order to see real change.
